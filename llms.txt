# AVD CLI

> A Python command-line interface for processing Arista AVD inventories and generating EOS device configurations, documentation, and ANTA tests using pyavd. Supports configuration deployment to EOS devices via eAPI.

This is a personal project and is not an official development of the Arista AVD team or Arista Networks. For official AVD tools, visit [avd.arista.com](https://avd.arista.com/).

**Key Features:**

- Generate EOS device configurations from AVD inventory files using pyavd
- Create comprehensive network documentation in Markdown format
- Generate ANTA test catalogs for network validation
- Deploy configurations to EOS devices via eAPI with diff statistics
- Generate Containerlab topologies for network testing and simulation
- Support for multiple AVD design types: L3LS-EVPN, MPLS, L2LS

**Supported Workflows:**

- **eos-design workflow**: Full pipeline executing eos_design followed by eos_cli_config_gen to generate configs from fabric definitions
- **cli-config workflow**: Direct configuration generation using eos_cli_config_gen only, consuming existing structured configurations

**Architecture:**

The CLI follows a layered architecture: CLI layer (Click commands with Rich output) → Logic layer (pure business logic with pyavd) → Models layer (dataclasses for inventory and device definitions). All CLI options support environment variables with the `AVD_CLI_` prefix.
