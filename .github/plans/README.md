# Implementation Plans Directory

The `.github/plans/` directory contains structured implementation plans produced for new features or refactors. Each file references the applicable prompt and includes front matter plus deterministic tasks.

## Available Plans

- `feature-containerlab-topology-1.md` – Adds `avd-cli generate topology containerlab` that converts AVD inventories into Containerlab topology definitions aligned with the Containerlab schema and infrastructure requirements.
- `feature-pyavd-version-management-1.md` – Adds pyavd version display in `--version` output and `avd-cli pyavd install <version>` command for managing pyavd versions.
