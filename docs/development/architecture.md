# Architecture

AVD CLI follows a clean, layered architecture:

- **cli/** - Command-line interface
- **models/** - Data models and validation
- **logics/** - Business logic
- **utils/** - Utility functions

See [Architecture Spec](https://github.com/titom73/avd-cli/blob/main/spec/tool-avd-cli-architecture.md).
